# Software Engineering for Machine Learning

## Basics

One should be able to evaluate the code (quality), trade-offs and complexities.

### SOLID

* [More examples in Python](https://github.com/dboyliao/SOLID)
* [Even more examples in Python](https://github.com/heykarimoff/solid.python)

### CI/CD

* [How to build a CI/CD pipeline with Docker](https://circleci.com/blog/build-cicd-piplines-using-docker/)

### Testing

Usual advice about >80% test coverage is not a good one. Your ideal coverage depends on how your system is architected.

### Linting

### Commenting

### Style Guide

* [Have and follow a Style Guide](https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2017/6/1/why-we-argue-style)

### Containerisation

## Principles

* [DRY, KISS and YAGNI are good principles to keep in mind](https://dev.to/luminousmen/what-are-the-best-software-engineering-principles--3p8n)
* Good to know about [LoD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter) and [POLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment)
* [duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction](https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction?duplication)
